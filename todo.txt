TODO

better mocha.json reporting for accurate title's and fullTitle's

NOTES:

* downgrade to karma-coverage@0.2.6 to prevent "split" error: https://github.com/karma-runner/karma-coverage/issues/123
* frameworks not always necessary, you can just use the files array directly for the smaller ones like karma-chai
* using the files array gives you control over order
** this lets you insert an init.spec.js for shimming
** init.spec.js must be preprocessed by browserify to resolve the 'packagenames' like 'jquery'
* prevent double build/runs with karma-browserify by not watching the spec files through karma (use pattern object in files array)
* added bzip2 to CI remote agent, for extracting phantomjs
* use `test || true` in bamboo to ignore non-0 exit code when test fails. mocha.json will report the failed tests, and the build will fail that way
* karma-mocha is where window.__coverage__ is added as `coverage` to the onBrowserComplete result
* temporary package published: https://www.npmjs.com/package/karma-coverage-allsources
