how to include has/nocover.js in report?
review other coverage reports (e.g. travis, coveralls)
historical coverage results


NOTES:

downgrade to karma-coverage@0.2.6 to prevent "split" error: https://github.com/karma-runner/karma-coverage/issues/123
frameworks not always necessary, you can just use the files array directly for the smaller ones like karma-chai
using the files array gives you control over order
	this lets you insert an init.spec.js for shimming
	init.spec.js must be preprocessed by browserify to resolve the 'packagenames' like 'jquery'
prevent double build/runs with karma-browserify by not watching the spec files through karma


LATERDO

run tests in
	IE
	SauceLabs
	node.js (jsdom?)
